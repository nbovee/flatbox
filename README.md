There are five major versions of the Flatbox. As this is a fork, the three I do not have modifications planned for have been dropped, find them [here](https://github.com/jfedor2/flatbox). They all use Kailh low profile (choc v1) mechanical keyboard switches. The table below lists their main features. See the README for each version for details on how to make them.
